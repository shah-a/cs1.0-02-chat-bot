# CS1.0 Assignment 2: Chat Bot

## Description

ATLA Bot

This program is a chat bot that returns quotes from "Avatar: The Last Airbender" chosen randomly from a list based on keywords detected in user input. Bot returns quotes endlessly until keyword "done" is detected. Otherwise, program looks for the name of a character. If program doesn't recognize any keywords, it returns an error message and then loops again.
